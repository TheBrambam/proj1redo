One thing that I feel that I could use to make parenting a little easier is to have an application that tracks a child’s extracurricular activities and progress, so that parents can see that their child is still engaged and improving their skills.

One parent I interviewed enjoys playing with robots, math, and reading. I thought it would be good to ask questions for what they enjoy doing together and a journaling project came to mind. Having the child do the typing in the application would also be beneficial to developing skills with a keyboard.

When engaging the interviewees, I chose to focus on what they didn't like about journaling entries because it would be something that I could code around instead of making things that would lead to a problem they didn't like. Having clear no-go features from the beginning helped me figure out a way to stay away from any bad features.

The user interface is presented with several options to start. Working fomr top to bottom, the user is greeted with the activity that they wanted to journal for the entry. This can assist them with keeping consistent or seeing if they may have beat a goal or not and make a comment on it. Important signifiers for the page were blatant to not only assist the user with their jornaling, but also have more reading and comprehension practice. Constraints that were present included only having a few choices so that the user would be reminded to complete the required entries.

Design prototypes:

Charts were discarded due to no back-end being used for saving entries. This required a complete re-do of the application.

Default Mode:

Light Mode:

Default mode was to keep with 508 compliance. The simplistic view was done so that a child could interact with fewer features and be less distracted. A failsafe was built in to make sure a date was selected prior to being able to move on with the entries being saved. Future updates to this application will be the database integration with charts so that progress can be tracked.

Updated interface:

This enabled the user to see old messages by selecting a date and the entry would appear in the upper right.
